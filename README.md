ðŸš€ BoAt Sales Dashboard: Data Insights at Your Fingertips ðŸ’¼ðŸ“Š

Excited to share a detailed sales and profit dashboard I created using Power BI and DAX! This project was all about transforming raw sales data into a clear, actionable dashboard, giving a snapshot of BoAtâ€™s performance over time. Here's a breakdown of how I approached this:

Step 1: Data Import & Transformation
I started by importing raw sales data into Power BI. Using Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data, ensuring it was ready for analysis. This included handling missing values and structuring the dataset.

Step 2: Data Modeling
Next, I built the relationships between various fact and dimension tables to create a dynamic dataset. This allowed for seamless interaction between different data points like regions, product categories, and sales quantities.

Step 3: Custom Measures with DAX
I used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures such as:
Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity.
Average Delivery Time to measure customer service efficiency.
Sales Forecast for future years using DAX time intelligence functions.

Step 4: Visualizing Insights
Sales by Category: Technology leads with 0.92M sales, followed by Office Supplies.
Sales by Region: The dashboard breaks down performance across different regions like Central, East, South, and West.
Monthly Trends: Tracking profit and sales patterns for 2019 and 2020 to observe seasonal spikes.
Segment Insights: Consumer sales dominate with 48%, while Corporate accounts for 32%.
Future Forecasting: Using DAX, I projected sales growth until 2030, giving a strategic view of where BoAt is headed.

Step 5: Enhancing Interactivity
Filters such as region and payment mode were added to allow deeper exploration of data, making the dashboard not just a reporting tool but a decision-making companion.

This project highlights my skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling. It was rewarding to see how well-structured data can help businesses understand their performance at a glance.
